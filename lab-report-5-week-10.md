# Lab Report 5 - Week 10
> Lab Goal: Choose any **TWO** tests from the 625 tests where I implementation has different answers that the implementation we provided for lab 9.

## Tasks:
 >How I found the tests with different results?

- For both of the different answers, I use **`vimdiff`** on the results of running a bash for loop.

>Provide a link to the test-file with TWO different-results

- This is my [first test-file link](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/512.md)
- This is my [second test-file link]()

>Describe which implementation is correct, or neither if both give the wrong output
